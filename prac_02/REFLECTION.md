# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
75%. I did not get to watch all of week 1 due to other commitments, however, I improved this for 
week two and watched all of the videos. 

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I have scheduled to watch lecture videos on Monday's at home in my study room. As I am home all day, 
I can dedicate the required amount of time for each lecture which I check on the Lecture Video 
information file prior to watching. 
 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I am keeping up with the practical exercises and actively learning Python the more I practice. Python
is new to me as I previously completed EG1002, so I'm working on understanding new concepts.
I also take time to read the instructions carefully before starting each task. 


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to practice more handwritten problems, as this will help me prepare for the final exam. I also need 
make comments on my code while I write it instead of looking back and having to do this step afterwards.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
As I am not used to the idea of committing. I did not commit my work after each step, as I didn't quite 
understand at the beginning of the week that the idea of committing your work is not to do it at the end,
however, as you are working through. This is something I acknowledge that I am doing extremely poorly in
so I will ensure for future practicals that I will commit my work as I go instead of at the end. 
I am not thorough with indenting and commenting which I want to improve, as it will make my work much 
easier to understand. I also must ensure to adhere to all Pythons correct formatting when doing this.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I am making sure to work through each and every step slowly and thoroughly to assist my 
learning as much as possible. I am also staying up to date with due dates to ensure I don't fall behind.
