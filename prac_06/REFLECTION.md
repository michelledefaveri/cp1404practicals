# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I have changed my committing and commenting process. Previously, I committed less frequently, which made it harder 
to follow my progress and understand changes in my code. Now I commit smaller updates more regularly, making my work 
easier to track. Additionally, I have also changed my process in regard to commenting, as I make an effort to comment
as I go opposed to all at once at the end.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I still need to improve how much I practice exam-style questions on paper. Since the final exam is written, I want
to spend more time solving problems by hand instead of relying on the computer.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
After misunderstanding the requirements for the submission for the second practical, I have made sure to read through
the pracs very thoroughly to ensure I don't lose any more unnecessary marks. Additionally, I have managed my time well
to ensure I watch all the lecture videos and complete the practicals before the deadline. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
As mentioned previously, I need to stop relying on the computer and start doing more written questions on paper to 
prepare for the final exam. I also need to stop rushing through practicals and lectures just to finish them, and 
instead spend more time actually learning, reviewing, and understanding the techniques.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
It would be helpful to have more guided examples that show the process of moving from problem description to code 
structure. I really like how in the lecture videos, exam-style questions are ran through so more of that would be 
helpful.
