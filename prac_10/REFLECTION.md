# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were generally close, however, were not perfect. I struggled particularly with estimating the
time it would take to complete lengthier programs, in example, the project management program. 
I found the simpler practicals easier to estimate accurately. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the trimester progressed, I became better at recognising which projects would 
take longer than others so my estimates gradually improved. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt that these estimates are really important, especially for real life situations. For example when you are 
given an assortment of tasks, you must be able to estimate how long each one will take so you know when to start them
to ensure they are finished in time. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned the importance of clear, readable code and how small improvements such as structure 
and removing repetition can make a difference. I also found it useful to see how other coders would 
have tackled the task, because it allowed me to take on their feedback and use it in future tasks.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing other people's code made me more aware of the best practices as well as common mistakes. 
It also improved my ability to spot issues in my own work and taught me how to give constructive 
feedback.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 7 Code Review](https://github.com/frank-chatpong/cp1404practicals/pull/3
)

### Explanation 

In this code review I gave clear, specific instructions. I pointed out repetition, in example, the MENU was already 
defined as a global variable so a function that redefined the menu to print it was not needed. As well as this, I also
ensured to give positive comments to acknowledge what the individual did well to keep the feedback balanced, 
constructive and encouraging. 

### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 6 Code Review](https://github.com/Calsgit/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

In this code review, I recognised that the user was missing docstrings and often forgot to finish the docstrings with 
a period. I suggested they should fix these mistakes to improve the readability of their code and to follow standard 
conventions. Similarly, I made sure to include positive comments that highlighted what the individual did well to 
maintain balanced feedback. 


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I have found this subject overall really well-structured. If I had to suggest one improvement it would be to 
provide more examples of lengthier programs and include short video explanations. I beleive this would help with 
understanding larger programs such as the project management program. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was consistent with writing clean, well structured code. I did not do as well on the earlier practicals so I ensured 
to take on provided feedback and pay closer attention to details. I also made sure to never cut myself short of time to 
ensure I completed all practicals on time.
