# CP1404 Practicals

## About the repository 
This repository contains my practical work for IT@JCU CP1404. It consists of weekly practicals sorted into their 
appropriate folders. For example, the first practical is found in the folder prac_01. 

## About me
My name is Michelle De Faveri, and I am a first year engineering student at JCU, majoring in electrical engineering. 
I am 18 years old and I live in Innisfail. 

## What I have learned about clean code
- Use clear and descriptive naming conventions to make code easy to read and understand.
- Each function should only be responsible for one job according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- Follow style guides and use tools like `PEP8` to keep code neat and easy to read.
